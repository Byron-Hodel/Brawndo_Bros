Hi my name is Austin Bower, I currently work as a server for a Korean BBQ in downtown Ann Arbor. 
I am attending WCC in hopes to transfer to a 4-year university. In my free time I like to play video games, disc golf, and enjoy the outdoors in general.
Something cool I did recently was server all U of M home football games in the suites and got to meet some very famous people while doing so.
I am excited to work with you all on our project this semester! Brawndo - It's what plants need.
