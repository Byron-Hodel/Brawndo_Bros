Hi everyone,  
My name is Nimco Ali but i go by Nimo,
I'm majoring in both Computer Science in java and Info Sys Programing in C++
This class is required for a major. 
I'm currently taking 4 courses including cps276.
I like to learn new languages and play video games. 
I know I'm lacking in few places, 
but I'm going to do my best to commit to this team and course.
Please feel free to let me know if I'm lacking in anyway, so I can fix it. 
Thank you so much everyone one for your help.
All the best, everyone
