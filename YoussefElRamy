My name is Youssef El Ramy, 
I'm married and have 3 kids, 2 daughters 1 son.
I'm currently seeking a bachelor degree in Information Systems, I took few courses in C++, and trying to practice more so I can use it!
I like music, I play guitar and saxophone. I enjoy repairing stuff, from electronics to projects around the house. 
Excited to be here and hoping to accomplish great things with the team!
