[Awkward greeting to reiterate name here]

I am taking this class with the intention to get an associates in science 
and transfer to a four year college to get a degree in computer science.

This course both excites and intimidates me as I love to program but I am 
not a naturally social person.  Either way I feel this course may be one of
the more important classes that I take.

I love to tinker with everything including software, electronics, cars, and
recipes.  I am curious how things work and what decisions were made in the
development process and why.
