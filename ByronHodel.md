Hi, my name is Byron.

Up to this point I have been programming for just over 5 years.

My favorite programming language is C, but I also know other languages like C++, C#, and Java.

I am interested in embedded systems, game development, networking, and 3d rendering.

My hobbies are reading, programming, and occationally playing games.

I do not have experience working in projects, so this is a rather new thing for me.
